## SR-U2764
This is the start of my journey of building my first ever hardware project + pcb + physical thing! i've never been into electronics before, but as soon as i got to know about highway, i quickly decided what i want to build -- my own mechanical keyboard! as keyboards are very expensive, and im planning to build my own desk setup soon, so it will look cool that i have my own made keyboard on my setup.

I want to make it clean, compact, and functional keyboard with no actual flaws. But doing mistakes is a part of journey - is'nt it?
