# ‚å®Ô∏è SR-U2764 - Journey Log
This is the start of my journey of building my first ever hardware project + pcb + physical thing! i've never been into electronics before, but as soon as i got to know about highway, i quickly decided what i want to build -- my own mechanical keyboard! as keyboards are very expensive, and im planning to build my own desk setup soon, so it will look cool that i have my own made keyboard on my setup.

I want to make it clean, compact, and functional keyboard with no actual flaws. **But doing mistakes is a part of journey - isn't it?**

# 11/07/25: Planning & Name Designation
# *Chapter 1Ô∏è‚É£: Deciding Name*
This was the start of this journey - i had to decide a name for this keyboard, at first i thought that i should name it with my surname - Ghalib. something like Ghalib-1.0 or something else, but then i thought it would feel a little bit cringe. then i decided that i want to dedicate it to a special person. Can't name them here - but if you are in my really short list of close friends, you already know that.

So I named this keyboard as codename of the bond between us. You can crack it easily btw ü•≤ was'nt able to name something that is easier to understand as well as difficult to crack, but still, i love this one.

# _Chapter 2Ô∏è‚É£: Planning The Specifications_

After that i started thinking about what do i want in this keyboard. It should have enough features as a normal keyboard while also easier to build and design as i have to do everything myself ü•≤ü•≤. So I went for these specifications:

- **60% ANSII Keyboard Layout**
- **Cherry MX Blue Switches**
- **An Oled Panel (Controllable from OS)**
- **Per -Key RGB Lighting**
